### NSPanel Sense

This in an android application that can be launched on Sonoff NSPanel Pro. It allows you to configure many panels
that are swiped horizontally. Whole configuration will be made through HomeAssistant add on (TBD). For now, configuration
is done by a local project file senseConfig.yml.
